# Deli Ordering System

## Description:
This project is a simple ordering system for a deli. Customers can add items like sandwiches, drinks,
and chips to their order, customize their sandwiches, and get a final total. Once the order is complete, 
the system generates a receipt with all the order details.

## Features
Adding Items to Order: Users can add sandwiches, drinks, and chips to their order through simple menu options.
Customizing Sandwiches: Users can pick a bread type, size, and toast option, and select from a variety of 
toppings (like cheese, meats, and sauces).
Automatic Price Calculation: The system adds up the prices of all items in the order to display the total cost at checkout.
Receipt Generation: Once the order is complete, the program saves a summary (or "receipt") in a text file with details of 
all items and the total cost.

## Main Menu
The `Main` class initializes the Deli Ordering System, displaying a menu for the user to add sandwiches, drinks, and chips to their order. 
It loops through the menu until the user chooses to check out, at which point it finalizes the order and saves a receipt.
